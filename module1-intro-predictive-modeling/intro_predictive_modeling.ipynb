    "\n",
    "#### Jason Brownlee, [Overfitting and Underfitting With Machine Learning Algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/overfitting-and-underfitting-with-machine-learning-algorithms/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal of a good machine learning model is to **generalize** well from the training data to any data from the problem domain. This allows us to make predictions in the future on data the model has never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The cause of poor performance in machine learning is either overfitting or underfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Overfitting** refers to a model that models the training data too well. Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Underfitting** refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ideally, you want to select a model at the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rob Hyndman & George Athanasopoulos, [_Forecasting: Principles and Practice_, Chapter 3.4](https://otexts.com/fpp2/accuracy.html), Evaluating forecast accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The following points should be noted.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - A model which fits the training data well will not necessarily forecast well.\n",
    "> - A perfect fit can always be obtained by using a model with enough parameters.\n",
    "> - Over-fitting a model to data is just as bad as failing to identify a systematic pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The accuracy of forecasts can only be determined by considering how well a model performs on new data that were not used when fitting the model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> When choosing models, it is common practice to separate the available data into two portions, training and test data, where the training data is used to estimate any parameters of a forecasting method and the test data is used to evaluate its accuracy. Because the test data is not used in determining the forecasts, it should provide a reliable indication of how well the model is likely to forecast on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://otexts.com/fpp2/fpp_files/figure-html/traintest-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The size of the test set is typically about 20% of the total sample, although this value depends on how long the sample is and how far ahead you want to forecast. The test set should ideally be at least as large as the maximum forecast horizon required.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some references describe the test set as the “hold-out set” because these data are “held out” of the data used for fitting.

We instead care about how well it will predict tomorrow’s price or next month’s price. \n",

We can use these patients to train a statistical learning method to predict risk of diabetes based on clinical measurements. In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for _future patients_ based on their clinical measurements. We are not very interested in whether or not the method accurately predicts diabetes risk for patients used to train the model, since we already know which of those patients have diabetes.\n",
