        "> The cause of poor performance in machine learning is either overfitting or underfitting the data.\n",
        "\n",

        "> When choosing models, it is common practice to separate the available data into two portions, training and test data, where the training data is used to estimate any parameters of a forecasting method and the test data is used to evaluate its accuracy. Because the test data is not used in determining the forecasts, it should provide a reliable indication of how well the model is likely to forecast on new data.\n",

In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for _future patients_ based on their clinical measurements. We are not very interested in whether or not the method accurately predicts diabetes risk for patients used to train the model, since we already know which of those patients have diabetes.\n",
