In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for _future patients_ based on their clinical measurements.

        "\n",
        ">***Your first goal should always, always, always be getting a generalized prediction as fast as possible.*** You shouldn't spend a lot of time trying to tune your model, trying to add features, trying to engineer features, until you've actually gotten one prediction, at least. \n",
        "\n",
        "> The reason why that's a really good thing is because then ***you'll set a benchmark*** for yourself, and you'll be able to directly see how much effort you put in translates to a better prediction. \n",
        "\n",
        "> What you'll find by working on many models: some effort you put in, actually has very little effect on how well your final model does at predicting new observations. Whereas some very easy changes actually have a lot of effect. And so you get better at allocating your time more effectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "> Why start with a baseline? A baseline will take you less than 1/10th of the time, and could provide up to 90% of the results. A baseline puts a more complex model into context. Baselines are easy to deploy.\n",

        "> *Consider carefully what would be a reasonable baseline against which to compare model performance.* This is important for the data science team in order to understand whether they indeed are improving performance, and is equally important for demonstrating to stakeholders that mining the data has added value.\n",
