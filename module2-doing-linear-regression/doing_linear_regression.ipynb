    "> Pipeline can be used to chain multiple estimators into one. This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification. Pipeline serves multiple purposes here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Convenience and encapsulation.** You only have to call fit and predict once on your data to fit a whole sequence of estimators.\n",
    "> - **Joint parameter selection.** You can grid search over parameters of all estimators in the pipeline at once.\n",
    "> - **Safety.** Pipelines help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model in cross-validation, by ensuring that the same samples are used to train the transformers and predictors."
