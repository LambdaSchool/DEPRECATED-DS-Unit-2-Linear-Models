    "[My mentor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-sanchez-62093847/) [taught me](https://youtu.be/0GrciaGYzV0?t=40s):\n",
    "\n",
    ">***Your first goal should always, always, always be getting a generalized prediction as fast as possible.*** You shouldn't spend a lot of time trying to tune your model, trying to add features, trying to engineer features, until you've actually gotten one prediction, at least. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The reason why that's a really good thing is because then ***you'll set a benchmark*** for yourself, and you'll be able to directly see how much effort you put in translates to a better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "> What you'll find by working on many models: some effort you put in, actually has very little effect on how well your final model does at predicting new observations. Whereas some very easy changes actually have a lot of effect. And so you get better at allocating your time more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mentor's advice is echoed and elaborated in several sources:\n",

    "\n",
    "> Why start with a baseline? A baseline will take you less than 1/10th of the time, and could provide up to 90% of the results. A baseline puts a more complex model into context. Baselines are easy to deploy.\n",
